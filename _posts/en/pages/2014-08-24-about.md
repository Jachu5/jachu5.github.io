## About me

Hi!</br>
My name is Alfredo, and I am a HCI and technology pasionate.
In my spare time I like learning and playing with anything related to mobile, computers, Android, Big Data, Machine Learnin, Art...

The purpose this blog is to learn, and the most effective way is learn by doing and later teaching it to someone else, or in this case, trying to do it.

This blog should be something interdisciplinary, where art, technology and people join together.

Let's see what happen!

If you have got any doubt, please don't hesitate contacting me <Jazuma5@gmail.com> or <https://plus.google.com/+AlfredoCerezo>.

See you!
